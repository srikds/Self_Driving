# ## Ideas for Lane Detection Pipeline

# **Some OpenCV functions (beyond those introduced in the lesson) that might be useful for this project are:**
# 
# `cv2.inRange()` for color selection  
# `cv2.fillPoly()` for regions selection  
# `cv2.line()` to draw lines on an image given endpoints  
# `cv2.addWeighted()` to coadd / overlay two images
# `cv2.cvtColor()` to grayscale or change color
# `cv2.imwrite()` to output images to file  
# `cv2.bitwise_and()` to apply a mask to an image
# 
# **Check out the OpenCV documentation to learn about these and discover even more awesome functionality!**

# ## Helper Functions

# Below are some helper functions to help get you started. They should look familiar from the lesson!

    the lines and extrapolate to the top and bottom of the lane.
